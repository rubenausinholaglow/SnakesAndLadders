# SnakesAndLadders

This is my solution for the Snakes and Ladders test from Voxel Group. 

Used TDD from the enunciated I as provided so I created a test for every UAT for every story.

Also I added more logic in order to be able to play the game.

The next steps would be to check the input for the number of players (that crashes if you do not provide a number) and improve the  game in order to have an interface.

The main idea for the Collection was to be a Singleton but I wasn't able to do it little tim so I preffer to provide the test instead of taking much time to fix it.
